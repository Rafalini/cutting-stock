The solution to the cutting stock problem - we further assume that steel rods are specifically cut here - is comprehensively discussed in the literature, but in this work we deal with its modified version. Compared to the original problem, the main difference is that some member lengths can be changed during the calculation if this improves the solution result. In this work, we compare two proprietary solutions using bar relaxation, based on the knapsack packing algorithm and the column generation method.
