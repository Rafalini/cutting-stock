abstract = {The article examines the sequential heuristic procedure for optimisation of roll cutting in the clothing industry. The issue of roll cutting can be defined as a bicriterial multidimensional knapsack problem with side constraints. To handle the bicriterial objective function a lexicographic approach is proposed. An item-oriented solution was found through a combination of approximations and heuristics. A sample problem is presented and solved.}
